    <p>Defines a variety of helper classes used for outputting DataSet and
    DataPoint objects to a variety of different output sources. In the
    initial implementation of this package the only output format supported
    is delimited text. This includes comma delimited form - also known as
    CSV (Comma Separated Values) - as the default output format. It is
    expected/hoped that other classes will be developed for outputting to
    such sources as a database (via a SQL SELECT statement), XML data
    sources, and others.</p>
