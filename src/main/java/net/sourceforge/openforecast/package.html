    <p>This is the main package for OpenForecast. It contains most of the
    classes and interfaces that the average user will use. Only the more
    advanced users that want access to specific forecasting models will need
    to access the subpackages.</p>

    <p>In general, you will initialize a DataSet object with a series of
    DataPoints that define a series of observations. Then you will pass this
    to the Forecaster.getBestForecast method to obtain a reference to the
    most appropriate forecast model for the given data set. This
    ForecastingModel can then be used to forecast additional values.</p>
