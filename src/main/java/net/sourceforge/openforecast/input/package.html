    <p>Defines a variety of helper classes used for creating DataSet and
    DataPoint objects from a variety of different input sources. In the
    initial implementation of this package the only input format supported
    is from CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. It is expected/hoped that
    other classes will be developed for inputting from such sources as a
    database (via a SQL SELECT statement), an XML data source, and others.</p>
